Odysseus - Design of Hardware Trojan
EECS573 FA15 Final Project
Authors: Xiaoming Guo, Sijia He, Jiong Xue


Verilog files modified: (Located at verilog/)
  1.Added Trojan.v (implementation of T1)
  2.Changed id_stage.v to add the Trojan

Random instruction generator:
  A python code is located at testgenerator/random_test_gen.py, along with 100 randomly generated testcases

Type 'make' before running the following scripts:
Scripts for testings:
  1.test.sh: Test all EECS470 testcases

  Uncomment the code for calling $display in id_stage.v before running 2 and 3
  2.test_random.sh: Test all the randomly generated testcases. 
  3.test_prob.sh: Test the probability that T1 and T2 are triggered.
  4.test_swactivity.sh: Test how many cycles out of total cycles are the two signals (specified in id_stage.v) equal to each other. 

Type 'make syn' to synthesize the whole processor

fib.s in the current directory is the modified testcase that can trigger the Trojan and cause an infinite loop.
